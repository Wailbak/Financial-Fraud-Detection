# Introduction
üìâ Fraud Detection Analysis: in this project we will explore how is the detection of fraudulent online payment transactions done. By analyzing various features of transactions, we will build a model that accurately identifies fraudulent activities. This comprehensive analysis includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning techniques to create a robust fraud detection system.

### Aim of the Project:
1. Exploring and preprocessing our dataset.
2. Visualizing the relationships between features.
3. Training and evaluating a machine learning model for fraud detection.
4. Predicting the likelihood of a transaction being fraudulent.

# The Analysis
Each step in this project is designed to thoroughly investigate the dataset and develop a reliable fraud detection model. Here's our approach to addressing each objective:

### 1. Data Preprocessing
* **Importing and Reading Dataset:** Initial loading and inspection of the dataset.
* **Null Value Check:** Confirming the absence of null values.
* **Categorical Transformation:** Converting categorical features into numerical values for model compatibility.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* **Transaction Type Analysis:** Counting and visualizing the different transaction types.
